# AECPokeFacade
Processing Example to control the facade of the Ars Electronica Center by using data about the gym in Pokemon Go.

#First use
Run the sketch by opening the file AECPokeFacade.pde with the Processing IDE. Run the sketch and watch for console output. It is necessary to go to https://google.com/device, select a Pokemon Go connected Google account and enter the shown code. Note that the Pokemon Go account must have finished the ingame tutorial by catching a starter Pokemon. After authenticating the application will receive an OAuth token which will be saved in the file system, what makes it necessary for the Processing IDE to be within a writeable directory at the moment. Not under C:\Program Files\ !
